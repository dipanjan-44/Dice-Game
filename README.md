Dice Game in C++

This is a simple command-line multiplayer Dice Game written in C++. It allows users to input player names, simulate dice rolls, and keeps track of wins over multiple rounds. The player with the highest roll in each round wins; in case of a tie, no winner is declared for that round. Itâ€™s a great beginner-level project for practicing object-oriented programming (OOP), random number generation, and basic C++ input/output.
